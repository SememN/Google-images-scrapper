# Google-images-scrapper
This script is a simple discord bot to save google images to your computer.
Unfortunately I couldn't format it to .exe so you must have python and these libraries installed on your computer:
-pip install discord.py
-pip install requests
-pip install bs4

So, to use this script you should create your own discord bot (you need to do it cause this is a script wich needs your api key).
Then you should download scrapper.py, start it with administrator rights and follow the instructions!
